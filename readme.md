# Black Hat Python Code Exercises
This repository is a collection of the code samples from Black Hat Python written by Justin Seitz with the samples rewritten in Python3. Since I'm using these exercises for learning, the code is not guaranteed to work as expected. That being said I tried to keep the functionality as close as I could to the book's examples.

Cheers!
